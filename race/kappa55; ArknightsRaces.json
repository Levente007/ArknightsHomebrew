Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 25 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny originium device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function if it is reduced to 0 HP or you use your Action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it.

If a device can function up to a specified amount of time and have different properties, they can maintain their function separately up to the time specified to them. If you activate both properties at the same time, they will maintain function until one of them reaches their maximum function time and the device will consume both properties' functionality. If a device reaches its maximum uptime, you need to spend 10 minutes with the device to restore it to function. Whenever you create the device you determine how their functions look or sound like. If you want to modify them, like make the device create a different sound and another image, you need to spend 10 minutes of work with it.

However, most Aegir are entirely humanoid, making their animalistic traits barely noticeable. All Aegir come from the oceans beyond the known world of Terra. On land, the Aegirs have to face the issues of dry skin. If left untreated, they will face severe symptoms like allergic reactions and chafing. Even though they hail from the ocean, ironically, a fair amount of them lack amphibious traits (i.e., breathing underwater), hence the reason why many Aegir cities are built within domes. They have a special connection with each other through song. To them, these songs are so special, that they don’t share them with land dwellers, only the ones they trust deeply. Because of their shared place of origin, Aegir can easily be corrupted into Seaborn either through scientific experiments, by succumbing to the monsters' alluring influence on the mind, or by being forcefully implanted Seaborn cells. Aegirs didn’t come into contact with originium, somehow the ocean granted them protection from it, only after some of them started to migrate to land, so their technology and methods are entirely foreign to land dwellers.
