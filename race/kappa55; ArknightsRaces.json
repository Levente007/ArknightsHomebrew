Someone can be naturally long living, some casters managed to prolong their life and many other unexplained ways, and it is not race dependent, as it is observed in most of the races in Terra. Note that, in this setting the longer a person lives, the more powerful it becomes and the more secrets it holds, so discuss the age of your character with your DM carefully."
